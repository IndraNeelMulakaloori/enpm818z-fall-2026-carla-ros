gt_boxes.py  --  GP2 Task 1: ground-truth 2D boxes from a CARLA recording.

A recording (tools/record_gp2.py) stores, for every saved frame, the camera's
pose, its intrinsic matrix K, a depth image in meters, a semantic image (one
CARLA tag per pixel), and the 8 world corners of every vehicle and pedestrian
near the AV. This module turns that into the 2D boxes a perfect detector
would draw: one box around the pixels where the camera sees each actor.

Two steps per actor. The 3D box, projected, says where in the image the actor
can be. That box is loose: it holds background around the actor, and up close
it is much larger than the actor. The depth and semantic images then say
which pixels inside it really show the actor, and the final box is drawn
around those pixels.

Given: the frame loader, the CARLA-to-optical rotation and the frame-level
assembly. Yours: project_points, box_from_corners and actor_pixels.
