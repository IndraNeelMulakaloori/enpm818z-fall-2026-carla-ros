    Both locations are (x, y, z) in CARLA vehicle coordinates, taken from
    your team's assigned rig. camera_pitch_deg is that rig's camera pitch.

    Three things decide this matrix, and L2 covers all of them.

    1. AXIS CONVENTION. K assumes the optical convention: x right, y down,
       z forward along the optical axis. CARLA uses x forward, y right,
       z up. Same three physical directions, different names, so the axes
       have to be relabelled before K ever sees them. Derive the relabelling
       from your own convention rather than copying one; the signs follow
       from which way each axis points.

    2. MOUNT ROTATION. Most teams have a camera that is not level with the
       vehicle. The relabelling above is then not sufficient on its own:
       you must compose it with the mount rotation, and the order matters.
       Getting the order backwards gives an overlay that looks almost right
       and is wrong by a few degrees, which is L2's one-degree error made
       visible.

    3. TRANSLATION. Work out where the LiDAR origin sits AS SEEN FROM the
       camera, then express that in the optical frame.

    Two checks you can run before hunting for bugs:

      * If the camera sits 1.5 m ahead of the LiDAR, a point 10 m ahead of
        the LiDAR must come out at a depth of 8.5 m, not 11.5 m.
      * Project a point and project it back. The round trip should return
        the number you started with.

    Returns:
        (4, 4) float64 array.
